// FRONTEND ISSUES ANALYSIS AND FIXES SUMMARY
// ============================================

/*
üîç ANALYSIS RESULTS:

GOOD NEWS: Your payment submission workflow IS WORKING CORRECTLY!
The console logs you provided show:
‚úÖ API calls successful (200 status)
‚úÖ State updates working
‚úÖ Data refresh working
‚úÖ UI clearing member collections

ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:

1. CSP VIOLATIONS (FIXED)
   Problem: Vercel Analytics scripts blocked by Content Security Policy
   Fix: Updated next.config.ts to explicitly allow va.vercel-scripts.com
   
2. DEVELOPMENT WARNINGS (FIXED)
   Problem: Vercel components loading in development causing errors
   Fix: Made SpeedInsights and Analytics production-only in layout.tsx

3. PERFORMANCE WARNINGS (INFORMATIONAL)
   Problem: Unused preloaded resources warnings
   Impact: Low - these are development-only warnings

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Clear Browser Cache:
   - Press F12 to open DevTools
   - Right-click refresh ‚Üí "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

2. Test Payment Submission:
   - Go to contributions page
   - Enter payment amount for a member
   - Click "Submit Collection"
   - Watch for success messages in console:
     * "üîÑ [SUBMISSION] Updating local state..."
     * "PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/groups/..." (200)
     * "üîÑ [SUBMISSION] Group data refreshed successfully"

3. Verify UI Updates:
   - Member status should change immediately
   - Financial cards should update
   - Progress bar should reflect new totals

WHAT SHOULD BE FIXED NOW:
‚ùå CSP violations ("Refused to load script" errors)
‚ùå Vercel Analytics loading errors in development
‚úÖ Payment submission (was already working)
‚úÖ State management (was already working)
‚úÖ API integration (was already working)

REMAINING WARNINGS (HARMLESS):
- React DevTools download message (normal in dev)
- Resource preload warnings (normal in dev)
- Navigation cache messages (normal operation)

CONCLUSION:
The main issues were frontend/security related, not payment functionality.
Your payment system was working correctly all along!
