# Group Edit Page Updates Summary

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Organization Field Fix**
- **Issue**: Organization was defined as enum with specific values
- **Fix**: Changed to string input field to allow any organization name
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/groups/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Schema and UI component
  - Changed from select dropdown to text input

### 2. **Global Share Amount Field Enhancement**
- **Issue**: Global Share Amount was editable but should be auto-calculated
- **Fix**: 
  - Made field read-only with calculated value
  - Added helper text explaining it's auto-calculated
  - Based on total group standing divided by number of members
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/groups/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - UI component styling and behavior

### 3. **Member Historical Data Restructuring**
- **Issue**: Showed initialShareAmount, initialLoanAmount, initialInterest
- **Fix**: 
  - Now shows only currentLoanAmount and familyMembersCount
  - Updated member interface and schema
  - Updated form fields and validation
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/groups/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Interface, schema, form fields, and submission logic
  - `app/api/groups/[id]/route.ts` - API response structure

### 4. **API Integration Updates**
- **Issue**: API wasn't returning familyMembersCount
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated API to include familyMembersCount in member data
  - Updated TypeScript interfaces to match
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/api/groups/[id]/route.ts` - Added familyMembersCount to response

## Updated Data Structure:

### Member Data (Before):
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  initialShareAmount: number | null;
  initialLoanAmount: number | null;
  initialInterest: number | null;
}
```

### Member Data (After):
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  currentLoanAmount: number | null;
  familyMembersCount: number | null;
}
```

## UI Changes:

1. **Organization Field**: Now a text input instead of dropdown
2. **Global Share Amount**: Read-only field with calculation explanation
3. **Member Section**: 
   - Renamed from "Member Historical Data" to "Member Information"
   - Shows only 2 fields per member: Current Loan Amount and Family Size
   - Better responsive layout (2 columns instead of 3)

## Form Validation:

- Organization: Optional string field
- Global Share Amount: Read-only (not validated)
- Member Current Loan Amount: Non-negative number
- Member Family Size: Positive integer (minimum 1)

## API Endpoints:

- `GET /api/groups/[id]`: Returns familyMembersCount for each member
- `PUT /api/groups/[id]/members/[memberId]`: Accepts currentLoanAmount and familyMembersCount updates

## Benefits:

1. **Simplified UI**: Less confusing fields, more focused on current data
2. **Better UX**: Auto-calculated share amount prevents manual errors
3. **More Flexible**: Organization field accepts any text value
4. **Data Accuracy**: Shows current loan amounts and family sizes that are actively used
5. **Responsive**: Better layout on mobile devices with 2-column member fields

The edit group page now properly fetches and displays all information from the group creation form, with the member section showing only the most relevant current data (loan amount and family size) rather than historical initialization data.
