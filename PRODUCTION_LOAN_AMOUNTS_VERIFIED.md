## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend (Working API: V27)
- **File**: `app/api/pdf-upload-v18/route.ts`
- **Features**: Robust pattern-based extraction with multiple fallback methods
- **Output**: JSON with members array containing `name`, `currentLoanAmount`, and totals

### Frontend Integration
- **File**: `app/components/MultiStepGroupForm.tsx`
- **Integration**: Calls `/api/pdf-upload-v18` with FormData field `pdf`
- **Display**: Step 4 shows individual member loan input fields
- **Fallback**: Handles both `currentLoanAmount` and `loanAmount` properties

### Data Flow
1. User uploads PDF in Step 2
2. Frontend sends to `/api/pdf-upload-v18`
3. Backend extracts data and returns JSON
4. Frontend processes response and populates member data
5. Step 4 displays loan amounts in individual member forms
6. Summary shows calculated totals
