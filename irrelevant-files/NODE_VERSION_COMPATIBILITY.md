# Node.js Version Compatibility Notice

## Current Status
- **Current Node.js Version**: v18.19.1
- **Required by pdfjs-dist**: >=20.16.0 || >=22.3.0
- **Recommended LTS**: v22.16.0 (LTS: Jod)

## Impact
The current Node.js version (v18.19.1) is causing compatibility warnings with the `pdfjs-dist` package. While the application currently works, this may cause issues in future updates or deployments.

## Recommendations

### Option 1: System-wide Node.js Upgrade (Recommended for Production)
```bash
# Using Node Version Manager (nvm) - recommended approach
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 22.16.0
nvm use 22.16.0
nvm alias default 22.16.0
```

### Option 2: Project-specific Node.js Version
```bash
# Create .nvmrc file for this project
echo "22.16.0" > .nvmrc

# Then use:
nvm use
```

### Option 3: Docker Environment (For Production Deployment)
Add to Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM node:22.16.0-alpine
# ... rest of your Docker configuration
```

## Benefits of Upgrading
1. **Full compatibility** with all dependencies
2. **Latest security updates** and performance improvements
3. **Better long-term support** (LTS version)
4. **Reduced warnings** during build and development

## Verification After Upgrade
```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should show v22.16.0

# Verify no more warnings
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Compatibility Notes
- **Next.js 15.3.3**: Fully compatible with Node.js 22.x
- **All other dependencies**: Compatible with Node.js 22.x
- **Development workflow**: No changes needed after upgrade
