# Periodic Records Text Visibility Fix - Complete

## Issue Reported
Users reported that the text in the periodic records page summary cards was not visible due to text color and background color matching the website theme, making content unreadable in both light and dark modes.

**Affected sections:**
- Meeting Details (Members Present, New Members)
- Cash Position (Cash in Hand, Cash in Bank, Total Standing)
- Period Income (New Contributions, Interest Earned, Late Fines, Loan Processing Fees)
- Period Summary (Total Collection, Expenses, Starting Balance)

## Root Cause
The previous styling used insufficient contrast ratios:
- Light backgrounds with medium-tone text colors
- Dark mode backgrounds with medium-tone text colors
- Border colors that didn't provide enough definition
- Lower opacity backgrounds that reduced readability

## Solution Applied
Enhanced the contrast and visibility in `/app/groups/[id]/periodic-records/page.tsx`:

### 1. **Improved Text Contrast**
- **Headers**: Changed from `text-color-800` to `text-color-900` (light mode) and `text-color-200` to `text-color-100` (dark mode)
- **Content**: Changed from `text-color-700` to `text-color-800` (light mode) and `text-color-300` to `text-color-200` (dark mode)

### 2. **Enhanced Background Visibility**
- Increased opacity from `/20` to `/30` for dark mode backgrounds
- This provides better contrast while maintaining theme consistency

### 3. **Better Border Definition**
- Changed border colors from `dark:border-color-700` to `dark:border-color-600`
- Provides clearer card boundaries in dark mode

### 4. **Additional Improvements**
- Added `shadow-md` for better card separation
- Enhanced main card container with better hover effects
- Improved loading and error message contrast
- Added proper text colors for main titles
