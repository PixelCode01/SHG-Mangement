# Late Fine Tier Calculation Bug Fix - COMPLETE

## Issue Summary
User reported that the late fine calculation for tier-based rules was showing **₹225** for 9 days late, but based on their tier configuration it should be **₹195**.

## Tier Configuration
- Days 1-3: ₹15 per day
- Days 4-15: ₹25 per day  
- Days 16+: ₹50 per day

## Expected vs Actual Calculation
**Expected for 9 days late:**
- Days 1-3: 3 × ₹15 = ₹45
- Days 4-9: 6 × ₹25 = ₹150
- **Total: ₹195**

**Actual (before fix):** ₹225

## Root Cause
The frontend `calculateLateFine` function in `/app/groups/[id]/contributions/page.tsx` had the old incorrect logic:

```typescript
// OLD INCORRECT CODE
const applicableTier = tierRules.find(tier => 
  daysLate >= tier.startDay && daysLate <= tier.endDay
);

if (applicableTier) {
  return roundToTwoDecimals(applicableTier.amount * daysLate);
}
```

This logic:
1. Found the tier for the **final day** (day 9 falls in the ₹25 tier)
2. Multiplied that tier amount by **total days late**: ₹25 × 9 = ₹225

## Fix Applied
Updated the frontend calculation to correctly sum daily fines for each day:

```typescript
// NEW CORRECT CODE
let totalFine = 0;

for (let day = 1; day <= daysLate; day++) {
  const applicableTier = tierRules.find(tier => 
    day >= tier.startDay && day <= tier.endDay
  );
  
  if (applicableTier) {
    if (applicableTier.isPercentage) {
      const tierRate = applicableTier.amount / 100;
      totalFine += expectedContribution * tierRate;
    } else {
      totalFine += applicableTier.amount;
    }
  }
}

return roundToTwoDecimals(totalFine);
```

## Files Modified
- `/app/groups/[id]/contributions/page.tsx` - Fixed frontend late fine calculation (lines ~596-632)

## Verification
Created test script that confirms:
- 9 days late now correctly calculates to **₹195** ✅
- Other scenarios also calculate correctly:
  - 1 day: ₹15
  - 3 days: ₹45  
  - 4 days: ₹70
  - 15 days: ₹345
  - 16 days: ₹395

## Status
✅ **FIXED AND DEPLOYED**

The development server has been restarted with the corrected calculation. The late fine display in the UI should now show ₹195 for 9 days late instead of ₹225.

## Note
The backend calculation in `/app/lib/late-fine-utils.ts` was already correct from previous fixes. This issue was specifically with the frontend calculation that displays the late fine to users.
