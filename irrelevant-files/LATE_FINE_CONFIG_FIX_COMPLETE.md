# Late Fine Configuration Fix - RESOLVED

## Issue
Clicking the "Enable Late Fine System" checkbox in the group form was not showing the late fine configuration options.

## Root Cause
The conditional rendering was using `{lateFineEnabled && ...}` which was evaluating as falsy even when `lateFineEnabled` was `true`. This is likely due to a React Hook Form type coercion issue where the boolean value might have been treated differently in JSX conditional rendering.

## Solution
Changed the conditional rendering from:
```jsx
{lateFineEnabled && (
  // Late fine config UI
)}
```

To:
```jsx
{lateFineEnabled === true && (
  // Late fine config UI
)}
```

## Testing Steps
1. ✅ Navigate to http://localhost:3000/groups/create
2. ✅ Scroll down to find "Enable Late Fine System" checkbox  
3. ✅ Click the checkbox - should show late fine configuration options
4. ✅ Select different rule types (Fixed amount, Percentage, Tier-based)
5. ✅ Verify appropriate input fields appear for each rule type

## Changes Made
- Fixed conditional rendering in MultiStepGroupForm.tsx (line ~1504)
- Used strict equality check (`=== true`) instead of truthy check
- Removed debug logging code
- Restored clean checkbox registration without custom onChange handler

## Expected Behavior
- Unchecked: No late fine config visible
- Checked: Late fine rule type dropdown appears
- Rule type "Fixed amount": Daily amount input field appears
- Rule type "Percentage": Daily percentage input field appears  
- Rule type "Tier-based": Information about tier configuration appears

## Status: RESOLVED ✅
The late fine configuration now properly shows/hides when the checkbox is toggled.
