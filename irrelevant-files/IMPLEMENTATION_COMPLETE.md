## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
```prisma
// Added new enums
enum CollectionFrequency { WEEKLY, FORTNIGHTLY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY }
enum DayOfWeek { MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY }
enum LateFineRuleType { DAILY_FIXED, DAILY_PERCENTAGE, TIER_BASED }
enum ContributionStatus { PENDING, PAID, OVERDUE, WAIVED }
enum CashAllocationType { BANK_TRANSFER, CASH_IN_HAND, CUSTOM_SPLIT }

// Added new models with full relationships
model LateFineRule { ... }
model LateFineRuleTier { ... } 
model MemberContribution { ... }
model CashAllocation { ... }
model ContributionReport { ... }
```

### API Routes Created
- `GET/POST /api/groups/[id]/contributions/current` - Current period contributions
- `PUT/DELETE /api/groups/[id]/contributions/[contributionId]` - Individual contribution management
- `POST/PUT /api/groups/[id]/allocations` - Cash allocation management
- `GET/POST /api/groups/[id]/reports` - Report generation and retrieval
- `POST/PUT /api/groups/[id]/contributions/bulk` - Bulk contribution operations

### UI Components Updated
- `MultiStepGroupForm.tsx` - Enhanced with new fields and conditional logic
- `page.tsx` (Group Details) - Added navigation to contribution tracking
- `page.tsx` (Contributions) - New comprehensive contribution tracking interface

## üîß Key Features in Detail

### Late Fine Calculation
- **Daily Fixed**: Fixed amount per day late
- **Daily Percentage**: Percentage of contribution amount per day
- **Tier-based**: Different rates for different time periods (e.g., 1-7 days: ‚Çπ10, 8-15 days: ‚Çπ25)

### Contribution Workflow
1. **Bulk Creation**: Create contributions for all members at period start
2. **Individual Tracking**: Track each member's payment status
3. **Late Fine Application**: Automatic calculation based on configured rules
4. **Payment Recording**: Mark payments and update balances
5. **Cash Allocation**: Allocate collected amounts to bank/cash
6. **Period Closure**: Close transactions and carry forward balances

### Member Management
- **Completion Tracking**: Hide/show members based on payment status
- **Outstanding Amounts**: Real-time calculation of dues
- **Payment History**: Track payment dates and amounts

## üß™ Testing
- **Prisma Operations**: All database operations tested and working
- **API Endpoints**: All endpoints functional with proper error handling
- **Type Safety**: Removed all temporary type workarounds
- **Database Relationships**: All foreign key relationships properly established
