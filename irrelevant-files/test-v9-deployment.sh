echo "========================================================"

echo ""
echo "🆕 V9 Changes Applied:"
echo "   ✅ Build ID: v9-ultimate-cache-bust-[timestamp]"
echo "   ✅ CSP: Completely unrestricted (script-src * worker-src *)"
echo "   ✅ Cache headers: max-age=0 on all static assets"
echo "   ✅ No-cache headers on all routes"

echo ""
echo "🌐 Deployment URL: https://shg-mangement.vercel.app"

echo ""
echo "📋 Testing Steps:"
echo "1. ⏳ Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel deployment"
echo "2. 🔄 Open browser in INCOGNITO/PRIVATE mode (mandatory!)"
echo "3. 🌐 Go to: https://shg-mangement.vercel.app/groups/create"
echo "4. 📁 Navigate to Step 2 (Import Members from PDF)"
echo "5. 📄 Upload a PDF file"
echo "6. 🔍 Open browser console (F12) and check results"

echo ""
echo "✅ Expected Success with V9:"
echo "   - Should still see some V6/V7 console messages (this is normal)"
echo "   - Should NOT see 'Refused to create a worker' errors"
echo "   - Should NOT see CSP violation errors"
echo "   - PDF workers should load from CDN without blocking"
echo "   - PDF extraction should complete successfully"

echo ""
echo "🔧 If V9 Still Shows Old Messages:"
echo "   - The aggressive cache busting should force new code"
echo "   - Try different browser or device"
echo "   - Clear all browser data for the site"
echo "   - Wait longer for Vercel cache invalidation"

echo ""
echo "📊 Expected Console Flow (V9):"
echo "   1. File selection messages"
echo "   2. PDF extraction starts"
echo "   3. NO CSP blocking errors"
echo "   4. PDF.js loads successfully from CDN"
echo "   5. Text extraction completes"
echo "   6. Members are parsed and displayed"

echo "🚀 V9 deployed at: $(date)"
echo "⏳ Vercel deployment in progress..."
echo ""
echo "🎯 KEY TEST: Try the same PDF that failed before!"
echo "📞 Report back with console output - should work this time!"
