echo "📋 Testing Checklist:"
echo "1. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete"
echo "2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)"
echo "3. Navigate to: Groups → Create Group → Step 2"
echo "4. Try uploading a PDF file"
echo "5. Open browser console (F12)"

echo "✅ Expected V8 Success Indicators:"
echo "   - Console shows: '🚀 [V8] Starting PDF extraction:'"
echo "   - Console shows: '🔧 [V8] Worker-free, CSP-compliant PDF processing enabled'"
echo "   - NO CSP violation errors"
echo "   - NO 'Refused to create a worker' errors"
echo "   - NO 'fake worker' warnings"
echo "   - PDF members extracted successfully"

echo ""
echo "❌ If Still Failing:"
echo "   - CSP errors still appear → Need V9 with zero PDF.js dependency"
echo "   - Worker errors persist → Need pure binary extraction"
echo "   - Cache not cleared → Try incognito/private browser mode"
