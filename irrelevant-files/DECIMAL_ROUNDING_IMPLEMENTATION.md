# Decimal Rounding Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented decimal rounding to 2 decimal places across the SHG contribution tracking system to ensure accurate monetary calculations.

## Files Modified

### 1. Created Currency Utility Module
- **File**: `/app/lib/currency-utils.ts`
- **Functions**:
  - `roundToTwoDecimals(amount: number)`: Rounds to 2 decimal places using proper rounding logic
  - `formatCurrency(amount: number)`: Formats as currency with 2 decimal places
  - `parseCurrencyInput(input: string)`: Parses currency input strings with validation

### 2. Updated Interest Calculation Utilities
- **File**: `/app/lib/interest-utils.ts`
- **Changes**: Added rounding to `calculatePeriodInterest()` function to ensure interest calculations are rounded to 2 decimal places

### 3. Updated Contribution Tracking Page
- **File**: `/app/groups/[id]/contributions/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added rounding to `calculateLateFine()` function for all late fine calculation types
  - Updated `calculateMemberContributions()` to round all monetary values
  - Added rounding to payment allocation logic in `markContributionPaid()`
  - Updated display formatting to use proper currency formatting
  - Applied rounding to totalExpected, remainingAmount, and paidAmount calculations

### 4. Updated API Endpoints
- **File**: `/app/api/groups/[id]/contributions/current/route.ts`
- **Changes**: Added rounding to contribution amounts and due amounts in POST endpoint

- **File**: `/app/api/groups/[id]/contributions/[contributionId]/route.ts`
- **Changes**: Added rounding to payment calculations and remaining amount calculations

- **File**: `/app/api/groups/[id]/contributions/bulk/route.ts`
- **Changes**: Added rounding to loan interest calculations and minimum due amounts

### 5. Updated Form Components
- **File**: `/app/components/PeriodicRecordForm.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added rounding to interest calculation helper function
  - Updated all monetary calculations in form to use proper rounding
  - Applied rounding to totalCollection, totalStanding, and share calculations

- **File**: `/app/components/MultiStepGroupForm.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added rounding to totalGroupStanding calculation
  - Updated monthly collection and interest calculations with rounding
  - Applied proper rounding to auto-calculated share amounts

## Key Rounding Rules Applied

### Monetary Calculations
- All monetary values are rounded to **2 decimal places**
- Interest calculations are rounded after computation
- Late fine calculations are rounded for all rule types (fixed, percentage, tier-based)
- Payment allocations are rounded during distribution

### Display Formatting
- Currency values displayed with consistent 2 decimal place formatting
- Used `formatCurrency()` function for consistent display across components
- Replaced manual `toLocaleString()` calls with proper currency formatting

### API Consistency
- All API endpoints now return rounded monetary values
- Database storage maintains precision while display shows rounded values
- Payment calculations ensure no accumulation of rounding errors

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Financial Records**: Prevents floating-point precision errors in monetary calculations
2. **Consistent Display**: All monetary values show exactly 2 decimal places
3. **Proper Accounting**: Ensures totals and balances are correctly calculated
4. **User-Friendly**: Display values are clean and professional
5. **Data Integrity**: Prevents accumulation of small rounding errors over time

## Testing Verification

A test file (`test-decimal-rounding.js`) was created to verify:
- Rounding function accuracy
- Currency formatting consistency
- Real-world calculation scenarios
- Edge cases with floating-point arithmetic

## Implementation Notes

- Used `Math.round((amount + Number.EPSILON) * 100) / 100` for robust rounding
- Applied rounding at calculation time rather than just display time
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing data
- All changes preserve existing functionality while adding precision control

This implementation ensures that all monetary calculations in the SHG management system are properly rounded to 2 decimal places, providing accurate and professional financial tracking.
