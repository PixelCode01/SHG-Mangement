# TERMINOLOGY UPDATE PROGRESS REPORT

## COMPLETED TASKS ✅

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- ✅ Updated Prisma schema field names:
  - `initialLoanAmount` → `currentLoanAmount` 
  - `initialShareAmount` → `currentShareAmount`
  - Updated field descriptions to reflect current vs historical data
- ✅ Generated new Prisma client with updated field names
- ✅ Database schema pushed successfully

### 2. Backend API Updates
- ✅ Modified `/app/api/groups/[id]/route.ts`:
  - Added `groupPeriodicRecords` in query
  - Implemented `currentShareAmountPerMember = totalGroupStanding / numberOfMembers` calculation
  - Updated member response format to use new field names
  - Maintained backward compatibility with `currentLoanBalance` field

- ✅ Updated `/app/api/groups/[id]/members/route.ts`:
  - Changed schema validation from `initialShareAmount/initialLoanAmount` to `currentShareAmount/currentLoanAmount`
  - Updated member creation logic to use new field names

- ✅ Updated `/app/api/groups/[id]/members/[memberId]/route.ts`:
  - Changed schema validation to use new field names
  - Updated membership update logic

- ✅ Updated `/app/api/members/import/route.ts`:
  - Changed `initialLoanAmount` to `currentLoanAmount` in member creation

### 3. Frontend Interface Updates
- ✅ Updated `/app/groups/[id]/page.tsx`:
  - Changed TypeScript interfaces to use new field names
  - Updated member mapping to use `currentShareAmount`, `currentLoanAmount`
  - Updated display labels from "Initial Share/Loan" to "Current Share/Loan"

- ✅ Updated `/app/groups/[id]/add-member/page.tsx`:
  - Changed Zod validation schema to use new field names
  - Updated form fields, labels, and error handling
  - Updated form payload to use new field names

- ✅ Updated `/app/groups/[id]/edit/page.tsx`:
  - Changed interface definitions to use new field names
  - Updated form schema validation
  - Updated form rendering with new field names and labels
  - Updated member data mapping and API calls

## CURRENT STATUS
**Progress: ~85% Complete**

### What's Working:
1. ✅ Database schema with new field names
2. ✅ Prisma client generation 
3. ✅ Group detail display with new terminology
4. ✅ Add member form with new field names
5. ✅ Edit group form with new field names
6. ✅ Current share calculation (`totalGroupStanding / numberOfMembers`)

### Remaining Issues:
1. ⚠️ TypeScript compilation errors in API routes (likely cache issue)
2. 🔄 Need to verify frontend forms are working correctly
3. 🔄 Need to test current share calculation in practice
4. 🔄 Need to update any remaining test scripts and documentation

## TESTING NEEDED
1. **Form Functionality**: Test adding new members with current share/loan amounts
2. **Group Display**: Verify current share calculation shows correctly
3. **Edit Functionality**: Test editing existing group member data
4. **API Integration**: Ensure all API endpoints work with new field names
5. **Data Migration**: Verify existing data is preserved and accessible

## NEXT STEPS
1. 🔄 Restart development server to clear TypeScript cache
2. 🔄 Test all forms and API endpoints
3. 🔄 Verify current share calculation works correctly
4. 🔄 Update any remaining documentation or test scripts
5. ✅ Mark implementation as complete

## TECHNICAL CHANGES SUMMARY

### Database Schema
```prisma
currentShareAmount Float? // Current share amount (calculated as totalGroupStanding / numberOfMembers)
currentLoanAmount  Float? // Current outstanding loan amount
```

### API Response Format
```typescript
currentShareAmount: currentShareAmountPerMember, // Calculated current share
currentLoanAmount: (m.currentLoanAmount || m.member.currentLoanAmount || 0) + 
                  (activeLoansTotal || 0),
```

### Frontend Display
```tsx
<p className="text-xs text-muted">Current Share: <span className="font-medium text-foreground">₹{member.currentShareAmount?.toLocaleString() ?? 'N/A'}</span></p>
<p className="text-xs text-muted">Current Loan: <span className="font-medium text-foreground">₹{member.currentLoanAmount?.toLocaleString() ?? 'N/A'}</span></p>
```

The terminology update is nearly complete with all major components updated to use "current" instead of "initial" terminology throughout the application.
