# Phone Number Authentication Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented dual authentication system allowing users to create accounts and login using either email address or phone number (or both).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added `phone` field to User model in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Added `phoneVerified` field for future phone verification functionality  
- Made phone field unique to prevent duplicate registrations
- Made both email and phone optional (user must provide at least one)

### 2. Authentication Backend Updates

#### Auth Configuration (`app/lib/auth-config.ts`)
- Updated NextAuth credentials provider to accept `identifier` instead of just `email`
- Added logic to detect whether identifier is email or phone using regex patterns
- Implemented phone number normalization (removes spaces, dashes, parentheses)
- Added support for phone-based user lookup using `findFirst` query

#### Registration API (`app/api/auth/register/route.ts`)
- Updated validation to require either email OR phone (not both required)
- Added phone number format validation (minimum 10 digits, supports international format)
- Updated user creation to handle both email and phone fields
- Added duplicate checking for both email and phone numbers
- Enhanced error handling for phone-specific constraint violations
- Updated member creation for GROUP_LEADER role to include phone

### 3. Frontend Updates

#### Login Page (`app/login/page.tsx`)
- Changed input field from "Email Address" to "Email or Phone Number"
- Updated state variable from `email` to `identifier`
- Modified form validation and submission to work with either input type
- Updated placeholder text to show both email and phone examples

#### Registration Page (`app/register/page.tsx`)
- Added separate phone number input field
- Made email field optional (shows "Email (Optional)")
- Added phone number field with validation
- Updated form validation to require at least one contact method
- Enhanced user feedback showing both contact methods are supported
- Updated success redirect to include phone information

### 4. Validation & Security

#### Phone Number Validation
- Frontend: Regex validation for international phone formats
- Backend: Normalization and format checking
- Unique constraint enforcement in database

#### Email Validation
- Maintained existing robust email validation
- Made email optional but validated when provided

## Technical Details

### Phone Number Handling
- **Normalization**: Removes spaces, dashes, and parentheses before storage
- **Format Support**: Supports various formats like +1234567890, (123) 456-7890, 123-456-7890
- **International**: Accepts country codes with + prefix
- **Validation**: Minimum 10 digits required

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters email or phone number in login form
2. System detects input type using regex patterns:
   - Email: Contains '@' symbol
   - Phone: Contains only digits, spaces, dashes, parentheses, and optional '+'
3. Database lookup performed based on input type
4. Standard password verification proceeds

### Database Impact
- Added phone field with unique index
- Existing users continue to work with email-only authentication
- New users can register with phone-only, email-only, or both

## Testing Completed
- Created comprehensive test script
- Verified user creation with phone, email, and both
- Tested phone number lookup and authentication
- Confirmed password hashing and verification
- Tested cleanup and constraint validation

## Usage Examples

### Registration
```
Name: John Doe
Email: (optional) john@example.com  
Phone: (optional) +1234567890
Password: securepass123
```

### Login
```
Email or Phone: john@example.com
Password: securepass123
```
OR
```
Email or Phone: +1234567890  
Password: securepass123
```

## Benefits
1. **Increased Accessibility**: Users can choose their preferred contact method
2. **Global Support**: Phone-based auth works better in regions with limited email usage
3. **Backup Options**: Users can provide both email and phone for account recovery
4. **Flexibility**: Existing email users continue working, new phone users supported
5. **Security**: Maintains same password security standards for both methods

## Future Enhancements
- SMS-based phone verification during registration
- Two-factor authentication using phone numbers
- Account recovery via SMS
- Phone number change functionality
- Automated phone verification status updates
