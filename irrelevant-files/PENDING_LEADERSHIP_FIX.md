# PendingLeadershipInvitations Component Fix

## Issue Fixed
The `PendingLeadershipInvitations` component was throwing an error: "User is not associated with a member profile" for GROUP_LEADER users who don't have automatic member records.

## Root Cause
After removing automatic member record creation for GROUP_LEADER users during registration, the API endpoint `/api/pending-leaderships` was still checking if users had a `memberId` and returning an error if they didn't.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `/app/api/pending-leaderships/route.ts`
**Before:**
```typescript
if (!session.user.memberId) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'User is not associated with a member profile.' }, { status: 403 });
}

try {
  const pendingInvitations = await prisma.pendingLeadership.findMany({
    where: {
      memberId: session.user.memberId,
      status: 'PENDING',
    },
```

**After:**
```typescript
try {
  // Handle both users with and without member profiles
  let whereClause: any = {
    status: 'PENDING',
  };

  if (session.user.memberId) {
    // User has a member profile, search by memberId
    whereClause.memberId = session.user.memberId;
  } else {
    // User doesn't have a member profile (e.g., GROUP_LEADER), 
    // they shouldn't have pending leadership invitations via memberId
    // Return empty array since leadership invitations are member-based
    return NextResponse.json([]);
  }

  const pendingInvitations = await prisma.pendingLeadership.findMany({
    where: whereClause,
```

### 2. Updated `/app/api/pending-leaderships/[invitationId]/route.ts`
Enhanced the error message to be more informative:
```typescript
if (!session.user.memberId) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'User is not associated with a member profile. Only users with member profiles can respond to leadership invitations.' }, { status: 403 });
}
```

## Why This Fix Works

1. **GROUP_LEADER users without member profiles**: These users will receive an empty array `[]` from the API, which the component handles gracefully by showing "No pending leadership invitations."

2. **MEMBER users with member profiles**: These users will have their invitations searched by `memberId` as before, maintaining existing functionality.

3. **Error prevention**: The component no longer throws the "User is not associated with a member profile" error for GROUP_LEADER users.

## Business Logic Explanation

- **Pending leadership invitations are member-based**: They are tied to specific member records in groups
- **GROUP_LEADER users without member profiles**: Cannot receive leadership invitations via the normal member-based system
- **Future leadership invitations**: If a GROUP_LEADER later creates a member profile for themselves, they could then receive leadership invitations

## Testing Results

✅ **GROUP_LEADER Registration**: Creates users with `memberId: null` and no automatic member records  
✅ **MEMBER Registration**: Still works correctly with proper member linking  
✅ **API Endpoint**: Returns empty array for users without member profiles instead of error  
✅ **Component Loading**: No more "User is not associated with a member profile" errors  

## Impact

- **PendingLeadershipInvitations component**: Now loads without errors for all user types
- **GROUP_LEADER users**: Can use the application without encountering this error
- **Existing functionality**: Preserved for MEMBER users with member profiles
- **Data integrity**: No changes to database schema or existing data

## Files Modified

1. `/app/api/pending-leaderships/route.ts` - Main API endpoint fix
2. `/app/api/pending-leaderships/[invitationId]/route.ts` - Enhanced error message

## Next Steps

The component should now work correctly for all user types. GROUP_LEADER users will see the component load without errors, showing "No pending leadership invitations" which is the correct behavior since they don't have member profiles to receive invitations.
