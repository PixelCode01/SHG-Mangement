echo "=================================================="

echo ""
echo "📋 DEPLOYMENT HISTORY:"
echo "1. ✅ Fixed PDF text extraction with advanced cleaning"
echo "2. ✅ Created V4 cache-bypass endpoint"
echo "3. ✅ Fixed all linting errors preventing deployment"
echo "4. ✅ Successful build completion"
echo "5. 🔄 V4 endpoint deployed but has runtime dependency issue"

echo ""
echo "🧪 TESTING RESULTS:"

echo "   Local V4: ✅ 51 members extracted successfully"

echo "   Production V4: ❌ 500 error (missing test file dependency)"

echo ""
echo "🎯 CURRENT STATUS:"
echo "   Core Solution: ✅ COMPLETE (works locally)"
echo "   Local Testing: ✅ All 51 members extracted perfectly"
echo "   Deployment: 🔄 Deployed with runtime issue"
echo "   Production V4: ❌ PDF library dependency error"

echo ""
echo "🔧 NEXT ACTION REQUIRED:"
echo "   The V4 endpoint is deployed but has a runtime dependency issue."
echo "   The frontend is configured to use V4 endpoint automatically."
echo "   Let's test if the original universal endpoint was fixed."

echo "📱 RECOMMENDATION:"
echo "   Test the web interface at: https://shg-mangement.vercel.app"
echo "   Upload a PDF file and check if members are extracted"
echo "   If V4 fails, it should fallback to universal endpoint"

echo ""
echo "✅ TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENT SUMMARY:"
echo "   - Advanced PDF text cleaning implemented ✅"
echo "   - Line break recovery for Excel PDFs ✅"
echo "   - Multiple parser strategy (PDF.js + pdf-parse) ✅"
echo "   - Robust pattern matching ✅"
echo "   - Local extraction: 51/51 members (100% success) ✅"
