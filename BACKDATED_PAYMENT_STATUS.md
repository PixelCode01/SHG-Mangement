- Integrated with existing payment submission workflow

##### Backend Changes

- Added late fine recalculation logic using existing utility functions
- Properly calculates days late based on submission date vs due date
- Applies group's late fine rules correctly

2. **Locate** the "Date" column in the contributions table
3. **Select** a custom date using the DatePicker for any member
4. **Enter** payment amounts in the contribution fields
5. **Submit** the payment and verify correct late fine calculation
6. **Check** that the payment record shows the selected submission date
