# Edit Group Form Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## Summary
Successfully implemented the requested changes to the edit group form functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Collection Frequency Conditional Fields
**Issue**: Collection frequency fields were shown all at once, making the form confusing.

**Solution**: 
- Added conditional rendering based on collection frequency selection
- **Weekly**: Shows day of week field only (required)
- **Monthly**: Shows day of month field only (required)
- **Fortnightly**: Shows day of week AND week pattern fields (both required)
- **Yearly**: Shows month AND date fields (both required)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Added `useWatch` hook to monitor `collectionFrequency` changes
- Updated schema validation with `superRefine` for conditional field requirements
- Replaced static form fields with conditional JSX rendering

### 2. Removed Share Amount Per Member Field
**Issue**: User requested removal of the "Share Amount Per Member" field from edit group form.

**Solution**: 
- Removed `globalShareAmount` field from the schema, interface, default values, and UI
- Removed the auto-calculated share amount display and related explanatory text
- Updated form submission logic to exclude this field

### 3. Complete Late Fine Configuration
**Issue**: Late fine section in edit form was simplified compared to group creation form.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced simple late fine fields with complete configuration like in group creation form
- Added `Controller` components for proper form state management
- Implemented conditional rendering for different rule types:
  - **DAILY_FIXED**: Shows daily amount input
  - **DAILY_PERCENTAGE**: Shows daily percentage input  
  - **TIER_BASED**: Shows tier configuration with 3 tiers (Days 1-5, 6-15, 16+)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Added complete `lateFineRuleSchema` with tier field support
- Updated form data population to handle existing late fine rules and tier data
- Added proper form submission transformation to convert tier fields to API format
- Enhanced UI with conditional sections that expand when late fine is enabled

## Files Modified

## Schema Changes
- Added comprehensive late fine rule schema with tier support

## UI Improvements

- Better user experience with guided field completion

## Validation Enhancements
- Added proper validation for collection frequency requirements:
  - Monthly/Yearly: requires day of month
  - Weekly/Fortnightly: requires day of week
  - Fortnightly: also requires week pattern
  - Yearly: also requires month selection
- Late fine rule validation when enabled:
  - Rule type is required
  - Amount/percentage fields required based on rule type
  - Tier configuration validation for tier-based rules

## Status
